# Robotics-RoverRuckus

## This repo contains a subset of the code written for Team 8872's competitive season from 2018-2019.

## Main objectives: 
  * autonomously drive the robot using motor encoders and openCV image detection to accomplish a set of tasks.
  * drive the robot using a Logitech gaming controller. 
  
## Videos of the robot in action:

### You can see how the robot uses the android phone onboard the robot to "find" the yellow cube and knock it from its place.
#### The robot is moving completely autonomously in the videos below. There is no user input :)
